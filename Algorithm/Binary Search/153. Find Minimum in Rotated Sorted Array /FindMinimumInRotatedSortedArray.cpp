/**
 Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:
 [4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
 [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
 Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.
 
 Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
 Output: 1
 Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
 
 Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
 Output: 0
 Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
