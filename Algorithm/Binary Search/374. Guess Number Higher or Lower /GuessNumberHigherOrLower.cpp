/**
 We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:
 
 I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.
 
 Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
 
 You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:
    * -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
    * 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
    * 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
 Return the number that I picked.
 
 Input: n = 10, pick = 6
 Output: 6
