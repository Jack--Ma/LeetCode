/**
 You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
 
 Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.
 
 Input: n = 5
 Output: 2
 Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
 
 Input: n = 8
 Output: 3
 Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
