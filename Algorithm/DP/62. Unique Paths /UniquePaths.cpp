/**
 There is a robot on an m x n grid. The robot is initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.
 
 Given the two integers m and n, return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

 The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.
 
 Input: m = 3, n = 7
 Output: 28
 
 Input: m = 3, n = 2
 Output: 3
 Explanation: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
 1. Right -> Down -> Down
 2. Down -> Down -> Right
 3. Down -> Right -> Down
