/**
 https://leetcode.com/problems/happy-number
 
 Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

 A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

 Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
 Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
 Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
 Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

//        struct S { static var v = 0 }
//        S.v += 1
