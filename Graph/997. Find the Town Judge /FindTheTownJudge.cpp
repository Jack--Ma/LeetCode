/**
 In a town, there are n people labeled from 1 to n. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
 
 If the town judge exists, then:
    1. The town judge trusts nobody.
    2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
    3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
 
 You are given an array trust where trust[i] = [ai, bi] representing that the person labeled ai trusts the person labeled bi.

 Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return -1 otherwise.
 
 Input: n = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
 Output: 2
 Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
 Output: 3
 Input: n = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
 Output: -1
